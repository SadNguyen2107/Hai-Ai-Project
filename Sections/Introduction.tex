\section{Introduction}
In beekeeping, the queen bee plays a vital role in maintaining the stability and development
of the bee colony. The queen is the reproductive center of the colony, and she also regulates
the activities and social structure within the hive \cite{anton2022introduction}. The loss of the queen bee
often leads to serious consequences such as reduced reproductive capacity, an imbalance in
colony activities, and can even lead to the complete collapse of the bee colony. Therefore,
early detection and warning of abnormal queen bee loss in beehives is crucial to ensure
production efficiency and maintain the health of the bee colony.

If the loss of the queen bee in the colony is not detected promptly, it can cause serious
problems such as an imbalance in the activities of the hive, leading to disorientation and
chaos, resulting in a decline in the bee population, leading to the weakening and eventual
death of the entire bee colony \cite{honey_bee_colony_2021}. Therefore, the need for a device to provide early
warning of queen loss is very important to help beekeepers intervene promptly. A warning
system can quickly detect the loss of the queen, allowing beekeepers to intervene by
replacing the queen with a new one or stimulating the colony to create a new queen before
the colony weakens, reducing the damage caused by the loss of the queen.

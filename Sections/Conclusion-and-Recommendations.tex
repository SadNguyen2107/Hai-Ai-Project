\section{Conclusion and Recommendations}
In this paper, we concluded that the AI sound classification system to support early
warning of queen loss will achieve an accuracy of more than 16\% higher and a speed
2.5 times faster when using the MFCC feature extraction technique with the CNN machine
learning model compared to LSTM+CNN. The system uses  sound from beehives, trainning AI
to predict anomalies with MFCCs (to represent sound as images) and CNN
(to extract important features from MFCCs), thereby optimizing bee care, improving
productivity and product quality, and saving time and costs in bee management. The
research group aims to continue researching, designing devices and developing equipment
to analyze and evaluate more abnormal cases in beehives to warn beekeepers such as:
warning of swarm division, insect attacks, diseases, etc.

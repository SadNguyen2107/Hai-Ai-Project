\section{Future Work}

The results of the research mark an important step in utilizing the MFCC+CNN technique
for detecting anomalies in beekeeping processes. However, to implement the system in
practical applications, the research team will continue refining and optimizing the product.
Future work will focus on leveraging the MFCC+CNN approach to analyze and identify a wider
range of abnormalities in beehives, such as warnings for swarm division, insect attacks, 
and diseases, as well as environmental stressors. This techniqueâ€™s ability to process 
sound data efficiently and extract meaningful features makes it a powerful tool for 
anomaly detection. Furthermore, this research highlights the potential for applying 
MFCC+CNN-based systems in broader agricultural contexts, supporting farmers in improving 
productivity, product quality, and operational efficiency.

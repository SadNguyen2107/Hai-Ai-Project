\section{Experimental Results}
In this experiment, we conducted tests using the MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
feature extraction method combined with two neural network models: CNN (Convolutional Neural
Network) and LSTM+CNN (Long Short-Term Memory + Convolutional Neural Network) to identify
bee sounds. The test dataset consisted of 500 untrained audio files collected using IoT
devices installed on Apis mellifera beehives at the Bee Center of the Vietnam National University of Agriculture,
including 405 audio files of bee colonies with queens and 110 files without
queen bees. The experimental results showed that the CNN model achieved an accuracy of
96.29\% (390/405) with a prediction time of 50.97 seconds, while the LSTM+CNN model only
achieved 80.24\% (325/405) accuracy and took 123.78 seconds to process.
The accuracy and processing time measurement in this research is
calculated base on this formular:

\begin{equation}
  \footnotesize \text{Accuracy}
  = \frac{\footnotesize \text{Number of predicted right} + \text{\footnotesize Number of silent file predicted}}{\small \text{Total number of file}}
\end{equation}
\vspace{-1em}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{equation}
  \text{Processing time} = \text{\small End process time} - \text{\small Start processing time}
\end{equation}
\vspace{-1em}

The results of the two models are presented in detail in \autoref{tab:model_comparison}:

      LSTM+CNN       & 80.24\%           & 123.78 seconds           \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}%

Analysis of the results shows that the CNN model not only outperforms in terms of accuracy
but also in processing speed, which is nearly 2.5 times faster than LSTM+CNN. The research
results also confirm the effectiveness of combining the MFCC feature extraction method with
the CNN model in the problem of anomaly detection through bee sound classification.
Although the LSTM+CNN model has a more complex structure, in this particular case, the
model does not yield higher performance compared to CNN.

From the experimental results, we can conclude that the combination of the MFCC feature
extraction method and the CNN network is an effective method for identifying bee sounds,
ensuring not only high accuracy but also fast processing speed, making it a good choice
for practical applications in this field.

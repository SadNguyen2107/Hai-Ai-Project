\section{Dataset}
Dataset in this research is collected at Vietnam National University of
Agriculture, to record queenless sound we created a queen-absent
situation in the hive: using a number of sample bee boxes, installing
data collection devices (IoT kits), we suddenly removed the queen for a
certain period of time, and then reintroduced the queen into the bee
box. This process was repeated several times, at different weather
conditions. All of this dataset is made by Hoang Le Nguyen and Hieu
Duy Tran from CDiT (https://cdit.ptit.edu.vn/) and it is the result of
"Research and apply technology from Industry 4.0 into production
management of honey for domestic consumption and exportation",
research code: "KC-4.0-20/19-25". \cite{pham2020industry4}

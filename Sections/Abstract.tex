\abstract{
    The beekeeping industry in Vietnam is thriving, contributing significantly to the
    agricultural economy through products like honey, pollen, and beeswax. However,
    the current manual management methods face many challenges in timely detecting
    abnormalities, especially the loss of the queen bee - an event that can cause
    significant disruption to the colony, reducing productivity and increasing the
    risk of colony collapse. Applying modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) is crucial for automating data collection and analysis on the bee colony's
    environment and health. Our research team has applied an AI model capable of using the
    results of sound feature extraction from bee colonies using MFCCs and making anomaly
    predictions using machine learning models such as CNN, LSTM+CNN. This technological
    solution not only helps reduce risks but also improves productivity and product quality,
    while reducing the manual inspection burden for beekeepers. The application of AI in
    beekeeping will bring greater accuracy, efficiency, and better management capabilities
    to the entire industry.
